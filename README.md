# stock-analysis

## Overview 

- Create vba macros to automize stock analysis based on year choice and local database.
- Re-factor this code to be more generalized, handle more data, and be faster

## Results

- We can tell from the below picutres that 1) 2017 was a better overall year for stocks than 2018 based on the stocks we analyzed. 2) the refactored code is faster.
- 2017: not refactored then refactored

## Summary

- Why refactor code?
  - The main reason to refactor code is: to make it better. This can be done by making the code shorter, making it easier to understand, or to be faster. Which we can see in this case we got faster code, and it is now more generalized.
  - The main problem with refactoring code is: you are essentailly redoing work that already completes the job. So if you just need it to work it can be a waste of time. However, in many cases we are wanting to make things more efficent so this is rarely a problem large enough to not do it.
